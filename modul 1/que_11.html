    <h2>What is the difference between a block-level element and an inline element?</h2>

    <p> <b>Ans:</b> Difference Between Inline and Block Elements in HTML <br>
        Block elements always start from a new line. Inline elements never start from a new line. <br> Block elements cover space from left to right as far as it can go. <br> Inline elements only cover the space as bounded by the tags in the HTML element. </p>


        <h3>Example 1 Block Element</h3>
        <h4>p tag is block elements</h4>
    <p style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</p>
        <h4>div tag is block elements</h4>
    <div style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</div>

    <p> <strong style="color: red;">note :</strong> The P and the DIV elements are both block elements, and they will always start on a new line and take up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).</p>

    <h3>Example 2 Inline Element</h3>

    <h4>span tag is inline element</h4>
    <p>This is an inline span <span style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</span> element inside a paragraph.</p>

    <p> <strong style="color: red;">note :</strong> The SPAN element is an inline element, and will not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.</p>
