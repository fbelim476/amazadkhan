    <h2>What is difference between HTML and XHTML?</h2>
    <p> <b>Ans :</b>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, whereas XHTML stands for Extensible Hypertext Markup Language. XHTML is basically an extension of HTML, which is stricter than HTML. Both languages are used to create web and Android applications. HTML is SGML based, whereas XHTML is an XML-based language.</p>
