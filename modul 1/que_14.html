    <h2>What is the use of a span tag? Explain with example?</h2>
    <p> <b>Ans:</b> The span tag is a paired tag means it has both open(<) and closing (>) tags, and it is mandatory to close the tag. <br> The span tag is used for the grouping of inline elements & this tag does not make any visual change by itself.  <br>span is very similar to the div tag, but div is a block-level tag and span is an inline tag.</p>

    <h2>Example</h2>
    
<h1>The span element</h1>

<p>My mother has <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">blue</span> eyes and my father has <span style="color:darkolivegreen;font-weight:bold">dark green</span> eyes.</p>
